<p>In the midst of growing political unrest in early July, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo closed and the State Department advised all non-essential U.S. citizens to leave Egypt. Our client, an aerospace and defense contractor, knew evacuations were imminent for their expatriates living in the region and they asked BCD Travel to handle the evacuation plan.</p>
<h2>A look back </h2>
<p>In 2010, a similar evacuation took place. The customer handled a majority of the evacuation process internally, using one member of their Travel Risk Management team. In this instance, all expats and their families were evacuated from Egypt via military aircraft to Paris, France.  Their coordinator was sent to Paris to set up a base to greet incoming expats and prepare them for their final destination. BCD provided a single point of contact to work with their coordinator to book flights out of Paris for everyone. Many of the expats had to layover in Paris for two days or more while documentation was verified and decisions about flight arrangements were made.  Although successful, the process involved added expense and time. Based on the information from that event, BCD devised a more efficient plan for future evacuations.</p>
